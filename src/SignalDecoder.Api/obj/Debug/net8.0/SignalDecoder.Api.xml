             <summary>
             Simulates a signal transmission by randomly selecting active devices
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             This endpoint simulates a real-world scenario where multiple devices can transmit simultaneously.
            
             **How it works:**
             1. Provide a dictionary of devices with their signal patterns
             2. The simulator randomly selects 1 to N devices to be "active"
             3. It computes the combined signal by summing the patterns position by position
             4. Returns the combined signal WITHOUT revealing which devices were active
            
             **Example Use Case:**
             You can use the generated devices from `/api/devices/generate` and pass them here
             to simulate a transmission, then use the result in `/api/signal/decode` to solve
             which devices were transmitting.
            
             **Signal Pattern Format:**
             - Each device has an array of integers (signal pattern)
             - All patterns must be the same length
             - Values are non-negative integers
             - The combined signal is the element-wise sum of active device patterns
             </remarks>
             <param name="request">Dictionary of devices with their signal patterns</param>
             <returns>Combined signal from randomly selected devices</returns>

             <summary>
             Decodes a received signal to identify which devices transmitted it
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             This endpoint solves the signal decoding problem: given a combined signal,
             find all possible combinations of devices that could have produced it.
            
             **How it works:**
             1. Provide the dictionary of all possible devices
             2. Provide the received (combined) signal
             3. Optionally set a tolerance for fuzzy matching
             4. The decoder finds ALL device combinations whose sum matches the received signal
            
             **Algorithm Features:**
             - Uses backtracking with intelligent pruning for efficiency
             - Returns ALL valid solutions (there may be multiple combinations)
             - Includes solve time in milliseconds for performance analysis
             - Handles up to 25 devices efficiently (under 5 seconds)
            
             **Tolerance Parameter:**
             - `tolerance = 0`: Exact match required (default)
             - `tolerance = 1`: Allows ±1 difference at each position
             - Higher tolerance finds more solutions but may include inexact matches
            
             **Example Workflow:**
             1. Generate devices: `GET /api/devices/generate?count=5`
             2. Simulate signal: `POST /api/signal/simulate` (with generated devices)
             3. Decode signal: `POST /api/signal/decode` (with simulated signal)
             4. Verify: One of the solutions should match the simulated transmission
             </remarks>

             <returns>All possible solutions showing which device combinations match the received signal</returns>
